[Stripe][stripe_home] is a payment platform that handles credit cards, bitcoin and ACH transfers. They have become one of the best platforms for handling payments for projects, services or products.

## Getting Started
In your `Package.swift` file, add the following

~~~~swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/stripe-provider.git", from: "2.2.0")
~~~~

Register the config and the provider in `configure.swift`
~~~~swift
let config = StripeConfig(productionKey: "sk_live_1234", testKey: "sk_test_1234")

services.register(config)
try services.register(StripeProvider())
~~~~

And you are all set. Interacting with the API is quite easy from any route handler.
~~~~swift

struct ChargeToken: Content {
    var token: String
}

func chargeCustomer(_ req: Request) throws -> EventLoopFuture<HTTPStatus> {
    return try req.content.decode(ChargeToken.self).flatMap { charge in
        return try req.make(StripeClient.self).charge.create(amount: 2500, currency: .usd, source: charge.token).map { stripeCharge in
            if stripeCharge.status == .success {
                return .ok
            } else {
                print("Stripe charge status: \(stripeCharge.status.rawValue)")
                return .badRequest
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~~

And you can always check the documentation to see the required paramaters for specific API calls.
